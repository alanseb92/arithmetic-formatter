Students in primary school often arrange arithmetic problems vertically to make them easier to solve. For example, "235 + 52" becomes:
```
  235
+  52
-----
```

It has been created a function that receives a list of strings that are arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side. The function should optionally take a second argument. When the second argument is set to `True`, the answers should be displayed.

### Development

Written the code in `arithmetic_arranger.py`. For development, you can use `main.py` to test your `arithmetic_arranger()` function. Click the "run" button and `main.py` will run.

### Testing

The unit tests for this project are in `test_module.py`. We are running the tests from `test_module.py` in `main.py` for your convenience. The tests will run automatically whenever you hit the "run" button. Alternatively you may run the tests by inputting `pytest` in the console.
